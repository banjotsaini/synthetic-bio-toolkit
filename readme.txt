Synthetic Biology Toolkit
A toolkit that uses machine learning (ML) and deep learning to assist in designing synthetic genetic constructs (e.g., promoters, CRISPR guides, ribosome binding sites) by predicting expression levels, off-target effects, and other performance metrics.

Overview
This project aims to streamline synthetic biology research by providing a user-friendly toolkit capable of:

Data Ingestion & Preprocessing: Importing biological sequences from public repositories (NCBI, iGEM, Addgene) and cleaning/organizing them.
Feature Engineering: Converting raw sequences into numerical representations (one-hot encoding, k-mer frequencies, GC content, advanced embeddings).
Model Training & Prediction: Using ML (Random Forest, XGBoost) or deep learning (CNN, Transformers) to predict various biological metrics like promoter strength, CRISPR guide efficiency, etc.
User-Friendly Interface: A command-line tool or minimal web dashboard where users can input desired sequence traits and receive recommended designs.
Features
Flexible Data Pipeline
Fetch sequences and associated metadata automatically, store them in a structured format, and quickly preprocess them for modeling.

Multiple Feature Representations

One-hot, k-mer, and GC content for simpler or smaller datasets.
Embeddings from advanced language models (e.g., DNABERT) for larger datasets.
Various ML/Deep Learning Models

Tree-based methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) for quick baselines and interpretability.
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architectures to capture long-range dependencies in sequences.
Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics

Regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²) for expression level predictions.
Classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC) for high/low categories or on/off-target guides.
Scalable & Extensible

Easily add new data sources (e.g., more CRISPR libraries, updated iGEM parts).
Integrates with Python’s ML ecosystem (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
Interpretability (Bonus)

Feature importance for tree-based models.
Attention weights or sequence motif visualization for neural networks.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
Packages (list is approximate; exact versions in requirements.txt):
numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
tensorflow or torch (depending on your deep learning framework)
biopython (for sequence handling)
requests (if automating downloads)
Optional:
dnabert, transformers (for advanced sequence embeddings)
Flask or Streamlit (if building a web interface)
Installation
Clone this repo:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/synthetic-biology-toolkit.git
cd synthetic-biology-toolkit
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Setup for advanced embeddings:

Install transformers, dnabert, or any other language model library you plan to use.
bash
Copy code
pip install transformers dnabert
Usage
Below is a typical workflow. Adjust names/paths to match your actual code files.

Data Collection & Preprocessing
Run the data pipeline to fetch sequences from your chosen sources, clean them, and store them in data/processed:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_pipeline.py --source iGEM --output data/processed/promoters.csv
Feature Engineering
Generate numeric features (one-hot, k-mer, etc.):

bash
Copy code
python src/feature_engineering.py --input data/processed/promoters.csv --output data/processed/features.npz
Model Training
Train a regression or classification model on the generated features:

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py --features data/processed/features.npz --model_type cnn --save_path models/cnn_model.h5
Prediction
Input a new sequence or list of sequences to get predicted expression or CRISPR efficiency:

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py --model_path models/cnn_model.h5 --sequence ACTGACGTGAC...
Optional Web Interface
If you have a web app (e.g., Streamlit or Flask), run it locally:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
# or
python src/web_app.py
Then open the provided local URL in your browser.
